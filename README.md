## Overview

# Voice-Enabled AI Chatbot (Powered by Murf AI)

This is a hands-on **AI project using Murf AI** where we build a **voice-enabled chatbot** using real code – not just drag-and-drop tools. If you're looking to learn how voice integration, APIs, and chatbot logic come together in a practical way, this project is for you.

## 🚀 What You'll Build

We’ll create a chatbot that:
- Understands user input using NLP logic
- Sends and receives responses from a backend
- Converts text to speech using **Murf AI**
- Feels interactive and human-like

This isn’t a no-code solution. We’ve written actual code to connect the chatbot, backend, and Murf AI for voice output.

- How to integrate **Murf AI** into your custom application
- How to handle real-time user inputs and responses
- Backend logic using Node.js / Flask (depending on what you used)
